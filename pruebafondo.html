<p>I decided to move my plugins from my private svn to Google Code. This means the code being developed is now public and can be viewed and reviewed by anyone.</p>
<p>I'm also trying to automate the building process with a makefile in order to make deploys less tedious (thus more frequent :)).</p>
<p>Everyone's invited to check the code, review it, comment and report bugs. The repository has a few plugins that I actually never released. It doesn't contain non-jQuery scripts yet. I haven't moved them yet and won't do yet.</p>
